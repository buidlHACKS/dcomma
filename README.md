We created this app for the buidlHACKS Hackathon:
## Wallet Folio: Web3 Application
Challenge Description
We at DeCommas believe that access to organized blockchain data can unlock a billion possibilities and so we provide the best single unified API to bring full transparency and visibility to assets across all blockchain networks. With the DeCommas API, there is no need to invest developer resources in writing SQL or other queries since granular, decoded, multi-chain data is immediately available for 30+ blockchain networks including Ethereum,Arbitrum, BSC, Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche. DeCommas is fast becoming the go-to data provider, with the DeCommas API powering over 1,000 industry-leading projects such as Zerion, ChainGuardians, 0x and Reef.

The DeCommas Unified API is the fastest way to get blockchain data for your GR14 Hackathon project!
