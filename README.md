I created this app for the 14th Hackthon of Gitcoin. Hackathon: Grants Round 14 Hackathon
## GR14: Web3 Application General Purpose Bounty (Covalent)
Challenge Description
We at Covalent believe that access to organized blockchain data can unlock a billion possibilities and so we provide the best single unified API to bring full transparency and visibility to assets across all blockchain networks. With the Covalent API, there is no need to invest developer resources in writing SQL or other queries since granular, decoded, multi-chain data is immediately available for 30+ blockchain networks including Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche. Covalent is fast becoming the go-to data provider, with the Covalent API powering over 1,000 industry-leading projects such as Zerion, ChainGuardians, 0x and Reef.

The Covalent Unified API is the fastest way to get blockchain data for your GR14 Hackathon project!
